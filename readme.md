# GregTech Lite

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Minecraft 1.12.2 (forge) modpack for GregTech CEu.

## Introduction

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;__GregTech Lite__, a.k.a _GTLite_, is a technology modpack based on GregTech CEu and its related mods. As the name suggests, this modpack focus on _simplification_ and _lightweight_.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In _GTLite_, you will play gregtech in a heart soothing and comfortable environment and fully experience its fun. Unlike other similar modpacks, _GTLite_ is not designed to emphasize the difficulty of gregtech or try to challenge players. We have added some mods such as _Applied Energistics 2_ and _Ender IO_ to simplify some of the content and adjust its balance. Only gregtech is available here, so you can fully enjoy this mod with peace of mind, without being disturbed by magic or adventure.

## Features

- This modpack can be played in peaceful mode, you just need to mines and explore caves;
- GregTech CEu, a actively developed gregtech version, and its related mods, bring you good gregtech experience;
- Many additions, e.g. balance adjustment, multiblocks, unification about other mods and recipes;
- A heavy but not cumbersome questbook, have more than 700 quests, used to guide your journey of gregtech;
- Many architecture and beautification mods, e.g. _chisel_ and _littletiles_;
